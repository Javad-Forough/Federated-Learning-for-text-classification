# Federated Text Classification

Federated Text Classification is a Python project showcasing the application of Federated Learning to text classification tasks using PySyft. Federated Learning enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while maintaining data privacy, making it particularly useful for scenarios involving sensitive text data.

## Features

- Implementation of Federated Learning for text classification tasks using PySyft.
- Support for tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.
- Collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy.
- Simple yet effective approach to federated learning, demonstrating how models can be trained collaboratively without exposing raw data.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to execute the Federated Text Classification task.

## Usage

- Modify the dataset or model architecture according to your requirements.
- Experiment with different text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.
- Explore advanced Federated Learning techniques and frameworks to enhance the project further.
